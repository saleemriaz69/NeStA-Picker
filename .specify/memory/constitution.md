# NeStA-Picker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality

All code must be clear, maintainable, and well-documented. Code should adhere to established style guides and best practices. All new code must be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer before being merged.

### II. Testing Standards

All new features must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. A minimum of 80% code coverage is required for all new code. All tests must pass before a feature can be deployed.

### III. User Experience Consistency

The user interface and experience shall be consistent across the entire application. All new UI components must adhere to the established design system and style guide.

### IV. Performance Requirements

The application must meet defined performance benchmarks. All new features must be tested for performance impact and optimized to ensure they do not degrade the user experience.

## Development Workflow

All development must follow a consistent workflow, including code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for all development practices. Any amendments to this constitution must be documented, reviewed, and approved by the project team.
